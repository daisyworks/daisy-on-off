    The Daisy On/Off application is for use with the Daisy Bluetooth breakout board. 
    It can be configured to control several output pins on the breakout board.
    
    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    Before the application can be used to control devices, you must configure your control buttons, what device they should connect to, and what function they should perform. 
    The main screen shows your configured control buttons, as well as a Configure button at the bottom. 
    When you first start the application, no buttons will be configured.
    Press the Configure button to add control buttons.      
    
    <h4>Adding New Buttons</h4>
    Click the button labeled "Add Button" to add new control button. The application currently limits you to 6 buttons.
    
    <h4>Removing Buttons</h4>
    The Configuration screen will show the configured buttons. Each button will have a red circle with an X in the lower, right corner. 
    Press the X to delete the corresponding button. You will be prompted for confirmation before the removal takes place.

    <h4>New Button Configuration</h4>
    For each button, you can configure the button label, the target Daisy, the target pin and the button behavior.
    
    <h5>Button Label</h5>
    The text entered here will show up on the given button on the main screen.
    
    <h5>Target Daisy</h5>
    You may select from a list of bluetooth devices that your Android device has paired with. 
    If you do not see the Daisy in the list, you should first pair with your daisy.
    
    <h5>Pin</h5>
    The device you wish to control will be connected to a pin on the Daisy Bluetooth breakout board. 
    Here you may select the pin that the device you wish to control is connected to.
    
    <h5>Button Behavior</h5>
    Button behavior will determine what happens when your button is pushed. The following behaviors are available.
    
    <ul>
      <li><b>On/Off</b> - Button presses will alternate between turning the device on and off</li>
      <li><b>One Second Pulse</b> - Each button press will turn the device on for one second</li>
      <li><b>Hold to Pulse</b> - The device will be turned on for as long as the button is pressed</li>
    </ul>
